NAME
    time cat -- everyone's favorite game

SYNOPSIS
    time cat

DESCRIPTION
    time cat is a game where you type time cat, hit enter, count to
    1000 milliseconds (counting quickly is recommended) then finally
    press control + c to get your score.

    For scores to be officially counted you must play with at least 1 other person. Each player must
    take only one turn at a time. If you go twice in a row your score will not be counted.

    The person closest to 1.000 second without going over wins.

    This is an online version of the one that is likely already installed
    on your computer. Open a terminal and type time cat to play offline.

DIFFICULTY SELECT
    * easy         --  1.000 second
    * normal       --  5.000 seconds
    * hard         -- 13.000 seconds
    * chronos bast -- 97.000 seconds
